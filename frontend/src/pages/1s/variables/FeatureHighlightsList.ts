      content: 'At the heart of the ARCH 1s sits the 124ci, high-torque ARCH / S&S V-twin engine, complemented by an ARCH-designed exhaust system. The chassis combines a steel mainframe with machined-billet aluminum subframe to create a unique performance architecture which gives the 1s intuitive handling and power delivery. Carbon fiber is used extensively throughout the 1s, providing a lighter, more agile riding experience.',

      title: 'SINGLE-SIDED SWINGARM',
      content: 'The 1s features the first single-sided swingarm from ARCH Motorcycle. Designed to be both functional and aesthetically appealing, the 1s swingarm follows our simple, elegant and efficient manufacturing philosophy. Functionality is improved via ease of maintenance and the rear carbon fiber wheel is unobstructed for visual appeal. Additionally, the swingarm works in conjunction with the Ã–hlins rear shock absorber to push the unsprung mass of the wheel and tire back to the road for a more responsive feel.',

      title: 'INTEGRATED FUEL + AIR SYSTEM',
      content: 'The ARCH 1s utilizes a carbon fiber fuel cell with a built-in air intake and filtration system. Airflow is fed through side vents at the front of the carbon tank leading directly to the intake system housed at the rear of the tank. This location reduces the bulk of a side-mounted air filtration system and creates a streamlined riding position while delivering optimal intake flow.',
